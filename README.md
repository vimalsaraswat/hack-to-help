# Hack4Change - Hackathon Management Platform

This project is a comprehensive hackathon management platform designed to streamline event organization and participation using cutting-edge orchestration platform Kestra.

## Key Features

- **Tech Stack**: Built with the T3 stack (Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and tRPC) and powered by PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for efficient database management.
- **Organiser Experience**: A user-friendly interface allows organisers to create new hackathons effortlessly.
- **Automation with Kestra**(Not fully working and deployed yet): Leveraging Kestra for orchestration, the platform automates key workflows like sending personalized reminder emails to participants:
  - When a hackathon starts.
  - As it approaches its end.
- **Participants Experience**: Participants can easily explore the hackathons on the project website's hackathons page.

This platform ensures an efficient, collaborative, and engaging hackathon experience for participants and organizers alike.
